# speech-emotion-recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition group project for a course in Machine Learning.

The code of this project is inspired by Muriel Kosak's article https://towardsdatascience.com/speech-emotion-recognition-using-ravdess-audio-dataset-ce19d162690.
Her code is replicated in the file TDS-example/tds-example.py.

This code is being modularized and modified for flexibility. 
This modularized version is able to create a dataset of metadata of audio files from the RAVDESS dataset and perform a mel spectrogram feature extraction on these audio files.
The next step is to split the data and create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
